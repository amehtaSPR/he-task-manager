## Getting Started
While waiting for npm install to go through, jump into the code from the entry file, i.e. index.js. Once the preview is loaded, open it in a new window.

You are given a table view. *3 minor bugs require* your attention.

## Bugs
1. The refresh icon should spin only when the refresh is in progress.
2. Click on the first task to open a card view. Then, click on refresh. You will notice that the data in the first row of the table updates, but it does not update in the card view. Also, when a card view for the first task is open, clicking on the second task in the table view should update the card view to show the second task. Currently, it still shows the first task. Fix these issues.
3. Editing a task in the card view should also update the task in the table view.

## Submission Instructions
1. Clicking "Run code" will compile and run your code against sample tests, but it will not generate scores. Click on "Execution Log" to better understand the test execution.
2. Clicking "Submit code" will run your code against multiple test cases, assessing different scenarios holistically. The score will be assigned accordingly.

To access the instructions, click on the "Question" button which can be found in the bottom left corner of the screen.
